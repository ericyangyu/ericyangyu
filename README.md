## Who I Am

I study computer science at UC San Diego. I do research in AI under Dr. Sicun Gao; more recent focuses include autonomous cars. I am also a Microsoft student ambassador and do cool stuff with Microsoft. Too lazy to add more stuff to this, so find out more of what I do [here on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-yu-engineer/). Just message me if you would like to chat more :)

## Who I Am (bored edition)
Favorite color: blue üîµ <br/>
Favorite videogame: Starcraft 2 (hmu if you are also fan) <br/>
Favorite animes: Death Note & Attack on Titan (I will defend these to my grave) <br/>
One regret in life: Not being born in time to watch Star Wars: A New Hope in theaters. <br/>

That's it for now; will update this more in the future. Check out my linkedin for more info, and msg me whenever! ‚úåÔ∏è happy scrolling.
