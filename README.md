## Who I Am

I study computer science at UC San Diego. I do research in AI under Dr. Sicun Gao. I am also a Microsoft student ambassador and do cool stuff with Microsoft. Too lazy to add more stuff to this, so find out more of what I do [here on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-yu-engineer/).
